        <div class="section-body" style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.95); line-height:1.7;">
          <p>Paul and Gwendolyn first met at a mutual friend's birthday celebration in 2021. What started as a casual conversation about their shared love for African art and culture turned into a deep connection that would change both of their lives forever. In that moment, neither knew they were meeting their soulmate.</p>

          <h3 style="color:var(--burnt-orange); margin-top:18px;">Our First Date</h3>
          <p>Our first official date was at the National Museum of Ghana, followed by dinner at a local restaurant specializing in traditional Ghanaian cuisine. We walked through galleries, discussed art, shared dreams, and talked for hours about our values, our families, and our hopes for the future. That day, we knew there was something truly special between us.</p>

          <h3 style="color:var(--burnt-orange); margin-top:18px;">The Proposal</h3>
          <p>On a beautiful evening in December 2023, Paul surprised Gwendolyn with a private boat ride on Lake Volta. As the sun set over the water, painting the sky in shades of gold and pink, he got down on one knee and asked her to spend the rest of her life with him. Through tears of joy, she said yes—forever yes. That sunset will be etched in our hearts forever.</p>

          <h3 style="color:var(--burnt-orange); margin-top:18px;">Our Shared Values</h3>
          <p>Our relationship is built on a foundation of faith, family, and cultural pride. We both value tradition while embracing the modern world, and we're excited to build a life together that honors our heritage while creating new traditions of our own. Together, we dream of a life filled with love, laughter, and service to our community.</p>
